        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Access to a clean, safe bathroom is a basic human right—but in Philadelphia, it's often treated like a privilege. Whether you're a commuter, a tourist, a delivery driver, or someone living without stable housing, finding a public restroom can be a frustrating and sometimes urgent challenge.</p>
        
        <p>Too few bathrooms are publicly available, and many that exist are hidden, poorly maintained, or require a purchase to use. This lack of access doesn't affect everyone equally. It disproportionately harms people with medical conditions, caregivers with young children, and unhoused individuals—people for whom "holding it" isn't always an option.</p>
        
        <p>Bathroom justice is about more than convenience. It's about dignity, health, and equity. Everyone deserves access to a clean, safe place to go, regardless of their income, housing status, or background.</p>
        
        <p>This website was built to help change that. By mapping bathrooms across Philadelphia, we hope to make this essential resource more visible, more accessible, and more equitable. Whether you're planning your day or helping someone in need, we believe no one should be left searching when nature calls.</p>
